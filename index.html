            <h2>Hello World!</h2>
            <p>My name is Kat. I'm a 28 year old from Minnesota. Currently, I am working for Starbucks as an 8 year
                Shift Supervisor, while simultaneously attending Arizona State University Online as a full time student.
                I plan to graduate in May of 2025 with a degree in Full-Stack Web Development.</p>
            <p>At the beginning of each session, almost every class has a discussion for the online students to
                introduce themselves. It's hard to find free time between work and school, and can be hard knowing what
                to say. So I figured why not make an introductory webpage!</p>

            <h2>Books of 2024</h2>
            <p>Reading a book is one of my favorite ways to pass time. I enjoy books about time travel, parallel
                realities, space travel, history, thrillers and mysteries. Getting drawn in to a fictional new world
                makes the stress of the world around me disappear. It's also fun to learn about topics I'm not familiar
                with. These are my favorite reads from 2024!</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Gone World</strong> is a mind bending science fiction thriller blending time travel,
                    quantum theory, and noir-style detective work. The story follows Shannon Moss, a NCIS agent
                    investigating gruesome murders connected to deep space exploration.</li>
                <li><strong>Recursion</strong> is a gripping science fiction thriller that dives into the nature of
                    memory, identity, and reality. Neuroscientist Helena Smith develops a technology to preserve
                    memories, but inadvertently spawns a phenomenon called False Memory Syndrome where people experience
                    alternate lives.</li>
                <li><strong>The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo</strong> a captivating novel about fame, love, and
                    identity. Reclusive Hollywood icon Evelyn Hugo chooses unknown journalist Monique Grant to write her
                    life story, unveiling scandal and her seven marriages.</li>
                <li><strong>Zero Days</strong> is a fast paced thriller following Jack, a penetration tester, whose life
                    is upended when she finds her husband brutally murdered and she becomes the prime suspect.</li>
                <li><strong>Eleanor Oliphant is Completely Fine</strong> is a heartwarming novel about loneliness,
                    healing, and human connection. Eleanor, a socially awkard woman leading an isolated life with a
                    traumatic past, develops an unexpected friendship with Raymond that changes her life.</li>

            <h2>Top 5 TV Shows</h2>
            <p>These are the shows I could rewatch over and over again. Whether they get put on as background noise, or
                actively watched. I enjoy shows that are packed with drama, have a lot of twists and turns, and are
                layered with comedy.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Charmed</strong> follows The Charmed Ones, the most-powerful, good witches of all time, who
                    use their power to protect innocent lives from demons and warlocks. Each sister possesses unique
                    magical powers that grow and evolve, while they attempt to maintain normal lives.</li>
                <li><strong>One Tree Hill</strong> is set in North Carolina, and initially follows the lives of two
                    half-brothers, Lucas and Nathan Scott, who compete for positions on their school's basketball team
                    and the drama that ensues from the brothers' respective romantic relationships.</li>
                <li><strong>Malcolm in the Middle</strong> revolves around Malcolm, who's revealed in the first episode
                    to be a genius with an IQ of 165, which places him in a class for gifted students. He is the
                    third-born child in a comically dysfunctional family of four boys, of Lois and Hal.</li>
                <li><strong>How to Get Away with Murder</strong> revolves around Annalise Keating, a defense attorney
                    and law professor at a prestigious Philadelphia university, who, along with five of her students,
                    becomes involved in a complex murder plot.</li>
                <li><strong>Gossip Girl</strong> follows a group of privileged teenagers who attend a prestigious high

            <h2>Things to Learn About</h2>
            <p id="learnP">There are so many interesting things to learn about in the world, and not enough time to
                learn them all! There is a whole range of topics that I like to learn about, but the topics I'm most
                interested in are listed below. I like to learn by reading books, watching videos and documentaries, or
                by first-hand practice.</p>
            <div id="accordion">
                <h3>Cosmology</h3>
                <div>
                    <p>Stars, planets, galaxies, black holes, and the greatest mystery of all, the nature of the
                        Universe. I was always interested in the night sky as a kid, but it wasn't until I took an
                        Astronomy class in college that I really started to learn about space. My favorite astronomical
                        object is Hoag's Object.</p>
                </div>
                <h3>Knitting</h3>
                <div>
                    <p>Knitting is a time consuming hobby. I learned how to knit by following along with video
                        tutorials. I only know basic stiches right now, but one day I want to make a big blanket with a
                        beautiful pattern on it. Or maybe even knit myself a sweater. There are so many fun colors of yarn
                        to choose from!</p>
                </div>
                <h3>Cooking</h3>
                <div>
                    <p>My partner and I recently just bought a house. Now that we have our own kitchen, an exploration
                        into cooking has begun. I try to follow along with recipe books or blogs, but it's fun to
                        tweak the recipes with new flavors. My current favorite dish to make is Green Chile Chicken
                        Enchiladas.</p>
                </div>
                <h3>Golf</h3>
                <div>
                    <p>I played golf in high school, but wasn't any good at it and didn't take it seriously. Now that
                        I'm older and have a better appreciation for the sport, I enjoy getting out to play more. I'm
                        learning how to have a consistent swing, proper stance and alignment, how to read the greens,
                        and the rules of the game.</p>
                </div>
                <h3>Fishing</h3>
                <div>
                    <p>Fishing is one of the most relaxing ways to spend a day, with the peaceful outdoors and calm
                        water. I didn't get into fishing until pretty recently, so I'm still learning about which
                        fishing rod to use, which lures to use and which hook size, line weights, and more, all
                        depending on which type of fish you're trying to catch.</p>
                </div>
                <h3>Cars</h3>
                <div>
                    <p>Car maintenance is the next thing I want to start learning about. So far I only know how to
                        change my headlights, but one day I hope to know how to change a flat tire, change the oil, and
                        replace a battery.</p>
